## Folder Structure Purpose

### components/
- **layout/**: Components that define the overall structure
- **carousel/**: Complex carousel component with its own logic
- **destinations/**: Core feature components for destinations
- **packages/**: Core feature components for travel packages
- **common/**: Reusable components across features

### pages/
Page-level components that combine multiple components

### assets/
Static resources including images and styles

### hooks/
Custom React hooks for reusable logic

### utils/
Helper functions and constants

### services/
API and data handling services

## Key Principles
1. Separation of Concerns - Each component has a single responsibility
2. Reusability - Common components are isolated and reusable
3. Maintainability - Related files are grouped together
4. Scalability - Easy to add new features
5. Feature-based Organization - Components grouped by feature rather than type

## Implementation Steps
1. Create new React project (Create React App or Vite)
2. Set up routing with React Router
3. Implement layout components (Navbar and Footer)
4. Create reusable card components
5. Implement feature components
6. Set up pages and connect everything together

## Benefits
- Better code organization
- Reusable components
- Easier maintenance
- Improved state management
- Better development experience
